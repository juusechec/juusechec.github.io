Our reported results are better than the original paper in terms of the median number of queries per attack, but worse in terms of failure rate. A concise assessment of our implementation is also included.","tags":["ml","reproduction","neurips"],"title":"[Re] Subspace Attack: Exploiting Promising Subspaces for Query-Efficient Black-box Attacks","type":"publication"}]
