My personal website, built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
The base theme is [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/), with some little edits by me. The website is automatically deployed using the [Hugo](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo) and [GH Pages](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages) actions by [@peaceiris](https://github.com/peaceiris).
